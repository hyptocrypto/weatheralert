Note:
A few things where unclear in the instructions. When changing settings, should only the next calls to the api be based on the new settings, or should the whole app reflect the new settings. Currently its the ladder, all data is reset to be based on the updated settings. Also, the settings file is never actually modified, the state of the settings is just managed in memory.
